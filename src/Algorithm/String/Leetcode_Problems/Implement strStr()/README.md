# DESCRIPTION
- Implement strStr().

- Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

- Clarification:

- What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

- For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
